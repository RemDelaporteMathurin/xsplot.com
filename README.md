This repository The source code for neutron cross section plotting website [xsplot.com](http://xsplot.com) which
allows neutron cross sections from TENDL 2019 to be plotted. Other libraries will be added soon.

This repository contains:
- A Python [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) based GUI üêç
- A Dockerfile that provides the hosting enviroment üê≥

# Run locally

You can view the hosted version of this repositoy here [xsplot.com](http://xsplot.com). However you might want to host your own version locally.

To host your own local version of [xsplot.com](http://xsplot.com) you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and then can build and run the Dockerfile
with the following commands.

First clone the repositoy
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openmc-data-storage/xsplot.com.git
```

Then navigate into the repositoy folder
```bash
cd xsplot
```

Then build the docker image
```bash
docker build -t xsplot .
```

Then run the docker image
```bash
docker run --network host -t xsplot
```

The URL of your locally hosted version should appear in the terminal, copy and paste this URL into a web browser address bar.

# Development install

Should you want to install the app locally here are some installation instructions for Ubuntu. You will need Python3, Pip and a few Gb of disk space.

Install dependencies for this app
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Install dependencies for processing the nuclear data
```
pip install pandas
pip install openmc_data_downloader
pip install openmc_data_to_json
```

Download and process some nuclear data
```
import pandas as pd
import json
import os
import pathlib

import openmc_data_downloader as odd
import openmc_data_to_json as odj


odd.just_in_time_library_generator(
    libraries='TENDL-2019',
    elements='all',
    destination='TENDL-2019'
)

odj.cross_section_h5_files_to_json_files(
    filenames = list(pathlib.Path('TENDL-2019').glob('*.h5')),
    output_dir = 'TENDL-2019_json',
    library='TENDL-2019',
    index_filename='TENDL-2019_index.json'
)


f = open('TENDL-2019_json/TENDL-2019_index.json')
data = json.load(f)
df = pd.json_normalize(data)

for col in df.columns:
    df[col] = df[col].astype(str)

h5File = "all_indexes.h5"
df.to_hdf(h5File, "/data/d1")

os.system('rm -rf TENDL-2019')
```

Run the app and then navigate to the url printed in the terminal

```
python app.py
```

# Maintenance

Pushing to the main branch of this repository triggers an automatic rebuild and
deployment of the new code using Google Cloud build at the [xsplot.com](http://xsplot.com)

The website makes use of a few other packages to process the nuclear data:
- [openmc_data_downloader](https://github.com/openmc-data-storage/openmc_data_downloader) to download processed h5 nuclear data files.
- [openmc_data_to_json](https://github.com/openmc-data-storage/openmc_data_to_json) to convert the h5 files (per isotope) into seperate reaction files.
- [nuclear_data_base_docker](https://github.com/openmc-data-storage/nuclear_data_base_docker) to provide a dockerfile containing all the required nuclear data with an index / loop up file containing every reaction available.
